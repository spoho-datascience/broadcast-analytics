"""
generate_player_visibility.py

This script demonstrates how player visibility was calculated by projecting
the camera field of view (FoV) onto player positions frame-by-frame.

In the study, the actual tracking data was used to determine which players were inside or
outside the visible pitch area at each moment.
Due to licensing restrictions, real tracking data cannot be published â€”
therefore, dummy player positions (based on standard formations) are generated here
to replicate the visibility calculation process transparently.

The output is a visibility mask saved as a JSON file,
indicating frame-by-frame player visibility for validation and illustration purposes.

---
Information for the User:

The dummy positions are generated using pre-defined 4-2-3-1 (home) and 3-5-2 (away) formations.
Precomputed pitch intersection files (`pitch_intersections/`) are provided in the supplemental material.
